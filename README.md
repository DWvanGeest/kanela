**Kanela** is a Java Agent written in Java 8+ and powered by [ByteBuddy] with some additionally [ASM] features to provide a simple way to instrument applications running on the JVM and allow introduce Kamon features such as context propagation and metrics.

- Continue to the new :sparkles: [Microsite](http://kamon-io.github.io/kanela/) :sparkles:
- Read the [**Changelog**](CHANGELOG.md) for more info.

### Modules ###

The modules currently available are:
  - [Akka](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-akka) for actor metrics and tracing inside a single JVM.
  - [Akka HTTP](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-akka-http) with client and service side tracing and HTTP server metrics.
  - [Futures](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-futures) bring automatic context propagation for Scala, Finagle and
    Scalaz futures.
  - [Executors](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-executors) context propagation and collects executor service metrics.
  - [Play Framework](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-play) with client and server side tracing.
  - [JDBC](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-jdbc) gives you metrics and tracing for JDBC statements execution and
    Hikari pool metrics.
  - [Logback](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-logback) comes with utilities for adding trace IDs to your logs and
    instrumentation to keep context when using async appenders.
  - [Spring Framework](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-spring) with client and service side tracing, context propagation and HTTP server metrics.
  - [Cassandra Driver](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-casssandra) gives you metrics, context propagation and tracing for C* statements.
  - [Annotation](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-annotation) provides a set of annotations that allow you to easily integrate Kamon's metrics and tracing facilities with your application.
  - [Netty](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-netty) with client and service side tracing and HTTP server metrics.(**wip**)
  - [OkHttp](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-okhttp) (**soon**)
  - [Kafka](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-kafka) (**soon**)
  - [Mongo](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-mongo) (**soon**)
  - [Akka Remote](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-akka-remote) has now serialization and remoting metrics and is able. (**soon**)

### Flavors ###
**Kanela** has 2 flavors, one is just the plain agent and gives us the option to add only the modules we need and 
the other is for those who want **APM-like experience** from the very beginning that contains all the modules embedded within the agent.

#### Plain
First, download the **Kanela** plain agent:

``` 
wget -O kanela-agent.jar 'https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=io.kamon&a=kanela-agent&v=LATEST'
```

Then, simply add the instrumentation modules that you want in your `build.sbt`, `pom.xml` or `gradle.build` file:

```
libraryDependencies += "io.kamon" %% "kamon-jdbc" % "1.0.0"
```

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.kamon</groupId>
    <artifactId>kamon-jdbc_2.12</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
``` 

```
compile group: 'io.kamon', name: 'kamon-jdbc_2.12', version: "1.0.0"
```

Finally, add the following JVM argument when starting your application in your IDE, 
your `Maven`, `SBT` or `Gradle` application script, or your `java -jar` command:

``
-javaagent:/path/to/the/kanela-agent.jar
``
 
![kanela-plain-jdbc][plain-jdbc]


#### Bundle
First, download the **Kanela** bundle agent that includes all the **Kamon** instrumentation modules embedded within the agent:

``` 
wget -O kanela-agent.jar 'https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=io.kamon&a=kanela-bundle-agent&v=LATEST'
```

Then, add the following JVM argument when starting your application in your IDE, 
your `Maven`, `SBT` or `Gradle` application script, or your `java -jar` command:

``
-javaagent:/path/to/the/kanela-bundle-agent.jar
``
Finally, simply Enjoy!
