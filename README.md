**Kanela** is a Java Agent written in Java 8+ and powered by [ByteBuddy] with some additionally [ASM] features to provide a simple way to instrument applications running on the JVM and allow introduce Kamon features such as context propagation and metrics.

Don’t see your preferred framework? We’re continually adding additional modules, check with our team to see if we can help or make your custom instrumentation with the **Kanela**
instrumentation API.


### Flavors ###
**Kanela** has 2 flavors, one is just the plain agent and gives us the option to add only the modules we need and 
the other is for those who want **APM-like experience** from the very beginning that contains all the modules embedded within the agent.

#### Plain
First, download the **Kanela** plain agent:

``` 
wget -O kanela-agent.jar 'https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=io.kamon&a=kanela-agent&v=LATEST'
```

Then, simply add the instrumentation modules that you want in your `build.sbt`, `pom.xml` or `gradle.build` file:

```
libraryDependencies += "io.kamon" %% "kamon-jdbc" % "1.0.0"
```

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.kamon</groupId>
    <artifactId>kamon-jdbc_2.12</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
``` 

```
compile group: 'io.kamon', name: 'kamon-jdbc_2.12', version: "1.0.0"
```

Finally, add the following JVM argument when starting your application in your IDE, 
your `Maven`, `SBT` or `Gradle` application script, or your `java -jar` command:

``
-javaagent:/path/to/the/kanela-agent.jar
``
 
![kanela-plain-jdbc][plain-jdbc]


#### Bundle
First, download the **Kanela** bundle agent that includes all the **Kamon** instrumentation modules embedded within the agent:

``` 
wget -O kanela-agent.jar 'https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=io.kamon&a=kanela-bundle-agent&v=LATEST'
```

Then, add the following JVM argument when starting your application in your IDE, 
your `Maven`, `SBT` or `Gradle` application script, or your `java -jar` command:

``
-javaagent:/path/to/the/kanela-bundle-agent.jar
``

Finally, Simply Enjoy!
